spontaneous vaginal births and less likely to have any pain medication,
epidurals, negative feelings about childbirth, vacuum or forceps-assisted

There is a smaller amount of evidence that doula support in labor can lower
postpartum depression in mothers.</p><p>The results of this study mean that if a birthing person has continuous labor
support (that is, someone who never leaves their side), both mothers and babies
have better outcomes!</p><p>Doulas remind you of what you really want. Doulas relieve the partner/husband
during long labors. Doulas are not scared of pain. Doulas focus on the Mom,
when everyone else in the room focuses on the baby.</p><p>Check out this PSA by DONA about doula work.<div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XItvGSq94rU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p>“Birth is not only about making babies. Birth is about making mothers&ndash;strong,
competent, capable mothers who trust themselves and know their inner strength.”

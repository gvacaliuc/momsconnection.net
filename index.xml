My name is Karen, and I am a certified birth and postpartum doula, connecting families through birth. I offer doula services in the Anderson, Knox, Morgan, and Roane Counties. I am passionate about mothers, babies, and family. I also have a deep desire to empower women through positive experiences of pregnancy, labor, childbirth, and the postpartum period.
I was born and raised in NH and moved to TN in 2009.</description></item><item><title>Doula Benefits</title><link>https://gvacaliuc.github.io/momsconnection.net/sections/benefits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gvacaliuc.github.io/momsconnection.net/sections/benefits/</guid><description>Overall, people who received continuous support were more likely to have spontaneous vaginal births and less likely to have any pain medication, epidurals, negative feelings about childbirth, vacuum or forceps-assisted births, and Cesareans. In addition, their labors were shorter by about 40 minutes and their babies were less likely to have low Apgar scores at birth. There is a smaller amount of evidence that doula support in labor can lower postpartum depression in mothers.</description></item><item><title>Cesarean Doulas</title><link>https://gvacaliuc.github.io/momsconnection.net/posts/cesarean-doulas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 07:13:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://gvacaliuc.github.io/momsconnection.net/posts/cesarean-doulas/</guid><description>I get this a lot, &amp;ldquo;Oh, doulas are just for natural, home births, right?&amp;rdquo; WRONG!

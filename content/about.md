Hello! My name is Karen, and I am a certified birth and postpartum doula,
connecting families through birth.  I offer doula services in the Anderson,
Knox, Morgan, and Roane Counties.  I am passionate about mothers, babies, and
family.  I also have a deep desire to empower women through positive
experiences of pregnancy, labor, childbirth, and the postpartum period.

I was born and raised in NH and moved to TN in 2009.  My past jobs have been
varied and included: administrative assistant, medical biller, costume
designer, short order cook, religious education coordinator, receptionist,
seamstress, mother, and wife.  All have been fulfilling and creative in their
own ways. 

Recently I had an epiphany.  It all started when I saw an interview with, of
all people, Melinda Gates.  Then I started reading her book, The Power of Lift.
I did not know she was Catholic, nor her passion for women.  Anyway, been
thinking about it a lot, and that got me thinking of how I can empower and help
women.  
 
I have 3 (mostly) grown children, all delivered by midwives, two with doula
help.  That got me thinking that maybe I could be a doula.  I started the
certification process with DONA (Doulas of North America) and have been so
excited to offer my doula services to moms and families in East TN.

Remember... The motherhood ideal is impossible to achieve because it ignores
reality.  Babies donâ€™t need super mothers, they just need good mothers.

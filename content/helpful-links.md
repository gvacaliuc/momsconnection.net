## Popular Labor Contraction Apps

### Contraction Master

This app works with iOS or Android as well as web-based. If
you are using the computer version, you do not need to be hooked up to the
internet once the program has loaded. It is also able to print your
contractions. This site has been live for a long time and has a long history.

### Contraction Timer App

This Android app is free and works easily. You simply
hit start and stop when a contraction begins and ends. This app will calculate
how far apart the contractions are for you and how long they last.

### Full Term

This iOS app is very basic, but also provides you with an easy to
use interface. (Can you click start and stop?) The app has a bright light which
can either be helpful or a hindrance, which really just depends on what you're
looking for in an app. When used at night, it's bright enough to see the
buttons and listings of previous contractions, without waking someone else up.
That said, if you're trying to time contractions while you stay asleep, you may
want to squint a bit.

### iBirth

This app is for iOS or Android. It's so much more than a contraction
timer. It has video clips to help you find good positions for labor. It offers
comfort measures. It even has information on nutrition. This was developed by
childbirth educators and doulas. It is a great tool for all moms. The timer is
a mere basic function along with the other goodies provided by this app.

### Contraction Timer Deluxe

This app is great because, not only does it time your
contractions, but this iOS app also plots your contractions on a graph for a
visual representation. It calculates how far apart, how long, etc. This can
help you see if your contractions are meeting the stronger, longer, and closer
together requirements that signal labor. There is also a free version
available.

### Lamaze Pregnancy to Parenting

This is for iOS or Android. The contraction timer is a part of a larger app
that handles everything from the basics of parenting through postpartum and
breastfeeding (including a feeding tracker).  And it's free.

## Two of my favorite poems about babies, birth, and mothering

### A Cradle Song by W.B. Yeats

    The angels are stooping
    Above your bed;
    They weary of trooping
    With the whimpering dead.

    God’s laughing in Heaven
    To see you so good;
    The Sailing Seven
    Are gay with His mood.

    I sigh that kiss you,
    For I must own
    That I shall miss you
    When you have grown.

### Morning Song by Sylvia Plath

    Love set you going like a fat gold watch.
    The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry   
    Took its place among the elements.

    Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.
    In a drafty museum, your nakedness
    Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.

    I’m no more your mother
    Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow
    Effacement at the wind’s hand.

    All night your moth-breath
    Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:
    A far sea moves in my ear.

    One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral
    In my Victorian nightgown.
    Your mouth opens clean as a cat’s. The window square

    Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try
    Your handful of notes;
    The clear vowels rise like balloons.

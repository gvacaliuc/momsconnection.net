## Popular Labor Contraction Apps

### Contraction Master

This app works with [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/contraction-master/id309120441 "Apple App Store") and has a web version for desktop use. If you are using the computer version, you do not need to be hooked up to the internet once the program has loaded. It is also able to print your contractions. This site has been live for a long time and has a long history.

### Contraction Timer App

This free app is available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/contraction-timer-counter-9m/id877303791 "App Store Link") and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neiman.contractions&hl=en_US&gl=US "Play Store Link") app and works easily. You simply hit start and stop when a contraction begins and ends. This app will calculate how far apart the contractions are for you and how long they last.

### Full Term

This [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/full-term-contraction-timer/id382013176 "Apple App Store") app is very basic, but provides you with an easy to use interface.  The app has a bright light which can either be helpful or a hindrance.  When used at night, it's bright enough to see the buttons and listings of previous contractions, without waking someone else up.

### iBirth

This app is for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ibirth-daily-pregnancy-postpartum-baby-tracker/id396521130 "Apple App Store") or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lulab.ibirthapp&hl=en_US&gl=US "Play Store"). It offers far more than a contraction timer including video clips suggesting good positions for labor, comfort measures, and information on nutrition.  Developed by childbirth educators and doulas, it is a great tool for all moms. The timer is a mere basic function along with the other goodies provided by this app.

### Sprout Pregnancy

This is for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sprout-pregnancy/id441977097 "Apple App Store") or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mas.apps.pregnancy&hl=en_US&gl=US "Play Store"). The contraction timer is a part of a larger app that handles pregnancy through postpartum including a kick counter contraction timer.

## Two of my favorite poems about babies, birth, and mothering

### A Cradle Song by W.B. Yeats

    The angels are stooping
    Above your bed;
    They weary of trooping
    With the whimpering dead.
    
    God’s laughing in Heaven
    To see you so good;
    The Sailing Seven
    Are gay with His mood.
    
    I sigh that kiss you,
    For I must own
    That I shall miss you
    When you have grown.

### Morning Song by Sylvia Plath

    Love set you going like a fat gold watch.
    The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry   
    Took its place among the elements.
    
    Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.
    In a drafty museum, your nakedness
    Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.
    
    I’m no more your mother
    Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow
    Effacement at the wind’s hand.
    
    All night your moth-breath
    Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:
    A far sea moves in my ear.
    
    One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral
    In my Victorian nightgown.
    Your mouth opens clean as a cat’s. The window square
    
    Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try
    Your handful of notes;
    The clear vowels rise like balloons.

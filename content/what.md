A doula is a trained professional who provides continuous physical, emotional and informational support to a mother before, during and shortly after childbirth to help her achieve the healthiest, most satisfying experience possible.

According to recent research (Continuous Support for Women During Childbirth, see link on Helpful Links page), people who received continuous support were more likely to have spontaneous vaginal births and less likely to have any pain medication, epidurals, negative feelings about childbirth, vacuum or forceps-assisted births, and cesareans. In addition, their labors were shorter by about 40 minutes and their babies were less likely to have low Apgar scores at birth. There is evidence that doula support in labor can lower postpartum depression in mothers.

The results of this above referenced study mean that if a birthing person has continuous labor support (that is, someone who never leaves their side), both mothers and babies have better outcomes!

Doulas remind you of what you really want. Doulas relieve the partner/husband during long labors. Doulas are not scared of pain. Doulas focus on the mother, when everyone else in the room focuses on the baby.

“Birth is not only about making babies. Birth is about making mothers--strong, competent, capable mothers who trust themselves and know their inner strength.”

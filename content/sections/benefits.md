Overall, people who received continuous support were more likely to have
spontaneous vaginal births and less likely to have any pain medication,
epidurals, negative feelings about childbirth, vacuum or forceps-assisted
births, and Cesareans. In addition, their labors were shorter by about 40
minutes and their babies were less likely to have low Apgar scores at birth.
There is a smaller amount of evidence that doula support in labor can lower
postpartum depression in mothers.

The results of this study mean that if a birthing person has continuous labor
support (that is, someone who never leaves their side), both mothers and babies
have better outcomes!

Doulas remind you of what you really want.  Doulas relieve the partner/husband
during long labors.  Doulas are not scared of pain.  Doulas focus on the Mom,
when everyone else in the room focuses on the baby.

“Birth is not only about making babies. Birth is about making mothers--strong,
competent, capable mothers who trust themselves and know their inner strength.”

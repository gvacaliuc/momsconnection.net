My name is Karen, and I am a certified birth doula,
connecting families through birth. I offer doula services in the Anderson,
Knox, Morgan, and Roane Counties. I am passionate about mothers, babies, and
family. I also have a deep desire to empower women through positive
experiences of pregnancy, labor, and childbirth.</p><p>I was born and raised in NH and moved to TN in 2009. My past jobs have been
varied and included: administrative assistant, medical biller, costume
designer, short order cook, religious education coordinator, receptionist,
seamstress, mother, and wife. All have been fulfilling and creative in their
own ways.</p><p>Recently I had an epiphany. It all started when I saw an interview with, of
all people, Melinda Gates. Then I started reading her book, <em>The Power of
Lift</em>. I did not know she was Catholic, nor her passion for women. Anyway,
been thinking about it a lot, and that got me thinking of how I can empower and
help women.</p><p>I have 3 (mostly) grown children, all delivered by midwives, two with doula
help. That got me thinking that maybe I could be a doula. I started the
certification process with DONA (Doulas of North America) and have been so
excited to offer my doula services to moms and families in East TN.</p><p>Remember&mldr; The motherhood ideal is impossible to achieve because it ignores
reality. Babies don’t need super mothers, they just need good mothers.</p><p><img src=/images/baby-sleeping.png#center alt></p></main></article><footer class=footer><div class=footer__social><a href=https://www.facebook.com/pg/Moms-Connection-Doula-Services-112331393525109 class=footer__social__link alt=facebook target=_blank aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/pg/Moms-Connection-Doula-Services-112331393525109 rel=noopener><span><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></span></a></div><address class=footer__contact><p class=footer__contact__item><span><i class="far fa-envelope"></i></span><a href=mailto:kvacaliuc@gmail.com class=footer__contact__link alt=Email>kvacaliuc@gmail.com</a></p><p class=footer__contact__item><span><i class="fas fa-phone"></i></span><a href=tel:%28865%29-386-5784 class=footer__contact__link alt=Phone>(865)-386-5784</a></p></address><div class=copy><p>© 2020 - Mom's Connection Doula Services</p></div><script src=https://momsconnection.net/js/bundle.min.243a483d5297388ef2f4a1b2d5e5d30218e01e8a2dfe213a376ea24d130837c860762a23e9daaa68ae3a7bcd5a3869287a14dc3b738f10486cf4e8fb4291b478.js></script><script defer src=https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.7.2/js/all.js integrity=sha384-0pzryjIRos8mFBWMzSSZApWtPl/5++eIfzYmTgBBmXYdhvxPc+XcFEk+zJwDgWbP crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>

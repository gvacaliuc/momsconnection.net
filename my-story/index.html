My name is Karen Vacaliuc, and I am a birth doula, connecting families through birth. I offer doula services in the Anderson, Knox, Morgan, and Roane Counties. I am passionate about mothers, babies, and family. I also have a deep desire to empower women through positive experiences of pregnancy, labor, and childbirth.</p><p>I was born and raised in New Hampshire and moved to Tennessee in 2009. My past jobs have been varied and include administrative assistant, medical biller, costume designer, short order cook, religious education coordinator, receptionist, seamstress, mother, and wife. All have been fulfilling and creative in their own ways.</p><p>I had an epiphany recently: I saw an interview with Melinda Gates and read her book, <strong><em>The Power of Lift.</em></strong> She is passionate about women and the how their empowerment can change the world. This resonated with me and got me thinking about how I too can empower and help women.</p><p>I have three mostly-grown children, all delivered by midwives, two with doula help. Reflecting on my own birth experiences convinced me to begin the certification process with Doulas of North America (DONA) and I am so excited to offer my doula services to mothers and families here in East Tennessee.</p><p>I know that the support I can give to mothers-to-be and their partners, during pregnancy and childbirth, can help make their experience less stressful, more informed, more comfortable, and more satisfying. One quote that I have read before stays with me. “The motherhood ideal is impossible to achieve because it ignores reality. Babies don’t need super mothers, they just need good mothers.” (author unknown) In working together with families, I hope to create a more healthy and satisfying approach to family dynamics in its early stages.</p><hr><p><img src=/images/baby-sleeping.png#center alt></p></main></article><footer class=footer><div class=footer__social><a href=https://www.facebook.com/pg/Moms-Connection-Doula-Services-112331393525109 class=footer__social__link alt=facebook target=_blank aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/pg/Moms-Connection-Doula-Services-112331393525109 rel=noopener><span><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></span></a></div><address class=footer__contact><p class=footer__contact__item><span><i class="far fa-envelope"></i></span><a href=mailto:karen@momsconnection.net class=footer__contact__link alt=Email>karen@momsconnection.net</a></p><p class=footer__contact__item><span><i class="fas fa-phone"></i></span><a href=tel:%28865%29-219-3913 class=footer__contact__link alt=Phone>(865)-219-3913</a></p></address><div class=copy><p>Mom's Connection Doula Services</p></div><script src=https://momsconnection.net/js/bundle.min.243a483d5297388ef2f4a1b2d5e5d30218e01e8a2dfe213a376ea24d130837c860762a23e9daaa68ae3a7bcd5a3869287a14dc3b738f10486cf4e8fb4291b478.js></script><script defer src=https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.7.2/js/all.js integrity=sha384-0pzryjIRos8mFBWMzSSZApWtPl/5++eIfzYmTgBBmXYdhvxPc+XcFEk+zJwDgWbP crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
